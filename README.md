# Quickbooks-Sheets-Integration

This is the source code for a published app on Quickbooks which integrates with Google Sheets to automatically update a sheet with operations that are performed on estimates in a user's Quickbooks company. I used AWS Lambda alongside AWS API Gateway to invoke the script according to certain https endpoints, and I stored authorization and authentication information securely using AWS DynamoDB. A google service account is used to read and edit a google sheet. It is specifically designed for the needs of my company, and can not easily be repurposed for personal use by any means.
